<h1 class="headingmain">Interest in IT</h1>
<div class="body">
<p>To me, IT has always been interesting. Since the age of 5-6 I would always spend as much time as I could learning more about IT. I started out on my Dad’s Windows XP computer writing my name in font size 72. I then built my Dad’s business computers with his IT consultant when I was 9. This love of IT continued to me installing OS on PC’s and running simple hardware and software diagnostics. This grew to networks and printers as well as console systems. I have done 1 programming subject prior to this where we played with an Arduino and an RPI. I still do not feel informed and capable to do as much as what I would like to. I am very interested in App development, software creation and hardware solutions to make everyday life easier.</p>
<p>I choose to study at RMIT because I was looking for a recognised university that had a good course structure. Previously I studied Mechanical Engineering at USC and was not enjoying the subject matter or the course structure. I am doing this course online which is also appealing as it allows me to work within my work schedule. RMIT appeared to have all the necessary requirements to help me learn the things that I need to become a successful IT worker.</p>
<p>During my studies, I expect to find out how to learn different programming languages, further my knowledge about IT hardware & have a qualification in the IT field.</p>

<p>This job is advertised by a school that is looking for a person to integrate IT with the teachers, administration and students. The role is to offer basic support, but also to teach and offer innovative ideas as to how IT can support and encourage more efficient and effective. The role is also to help the school look out for leading edge IT solutions that would make a powerful impact in the lives of the people at the school.</p>
<p>I am drawn to this role because I believe that IT can help people with their everyday life. School is a big part of life for every person so making this experience better and easier would be amazing! My wife works as a teacher in a high school and I have been thinking of ways to make her job, and the other teachers’ jobs simpler and more efficient through integrating IT better. Within this role, I am appealed to the opportunity to help people learn how to integrate IT into their normal work life to help them with and reduce the need to complete mundane tasks.</p>
<p>The role requires personal skills of integrity, leadership, teaching, flexibility, creativity and problem solving. The role also requires tertiary qualifications in IT and experience with databases & programming. </p>
<p>Currently, I have abilities and skills in basic software and hardware diagnostics and installation. I have built 5 high end gaming PCs in the last 2 years and have upwards of 10 work PCs in my life. I have helped family members and friends to resolve software and hardware issues with computers, phones, printers, networks, and hardware issues with appliances and machinery. I am a flexible and creative thinker who thrives on problem solving. I possess a great drive to complete tasks and enjoy the opportunity to expand my understanding. </p>
<p>My plan to obtain the necessary skills, qualifications and experience required for this position would be to complete this course to be a qualified IT specialist. This would open up a number of graduate and entry level opportunities where I can develop and enhance specific programming and software skills. Upon working in the IT field for a number of years, I could plan to make my way through a number of positions in IT solutions to eventually be promoted to an executive position where I can oversee IT integration and solutions. </p>

<h2 class="headingsub">Personal Analysis</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>The tests show me an indication of what my tendencies are. I feel like I can see a lot of myself in the results, but I can also see how the last one reflected more of how I was feeling when I took the test than how I would normally describe myself. </p>
<p>The tests results give me some ideas of how I can use my thinking/personality more productively and usefully. I can take some of the results and create better study/work habits. For example, by being a Tactile learner, the jobs I would find most useful and appealing would be those that require me to do something. Thus, jobs such as IT repairs, software and hardware development and IT integration would be best suited to me. Additionally, as a Campaigner, I am very curious and observant, which would help me to see things others may miss and offer unique perspectives in the workplace. However, I do find it difficult to focus on tasks that I find little value in, so being aware of this would help in responding to the issue should it arise. From the OCEAN test, I also found that I was very agreeable and conscientious, meaning that I would be able to help and support those around me, whilst being able see the big picture.</p>
<p>My results indicate that I favour being in more of a leadership role. This would impact my behaviour within a team as I would try to lead and organise the people to complete a task in an efficient way. As an extraverted person, working in a team would suit me as I can communicate and bounce ideas off of others. However, I do like to work independently, as described in the Myers-Briggs test. This may impact my ability to work collaboratively in a team as I would want to have my own role and not share a role with someone else. As a leader, I would use my position to the benefit of the team, not myself. If I were in a team where I could not take a leadership role, this may cause me to feel boxed in and numb my creativity. As a Campaigner, this would be very difficult as it would lead me to become less focused and enthused.</p>
<p>When forming a team, I should make sure that I am not trying to do the same role as someone else. Rather, I would clearly define and understand the role that I have and the roles of the team members. I would be aware of my tendencies towards others and adapt to the circumstances to help those around me so we could succeed together as a team. From the Myers-Briggs test, I found that as a Campaigner, I have a keen ability to compliment the communication and experiences of those around me whilst offering exciting and unique ideas to projects. Campaigners are excellent communicators and are very approachable, so I would be able to get to know those around me well and make them feel comfortable in the work environment.</p>

<h1 class="headingmain">Project Idea</h1>

<h2 class="headingsub">Overview</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>The project will make it easier for golfers to find their golf balls. The project deliverables consist’ of two parts. One part is a machine that tracks the golf ball and guides the golfer to the ball. The other part is the golf ball that can be easily tracked by the machine. The project will need hardware for at least the machine. The project will need software integrated into the machine for all the needed functionalities that are desired.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="headingsub">Motivation</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>I try each day to help people around me. This course is helping me to be able to use IT to make people’s lives better or easier. I would like to do a project that will help people. Projects with programming and hardware aspects could help me gain required experience and knowledge needed to work in my ideal job.</p>
<p>In every round of golf played around the world there is a ball hit to a spot that should be “fine” until you cannot find it. I played golf with a retired gentleman, he hit his ball to a lone tree surrounded by grass. I did not even think that there is a chance that the ball cannot be found. To my astonishment after 5 minutes of looking we could not find his golf ball.</p>
<p>I would like to make a round on the golf course more enjoyable. I would like to help this “fine” golf ball to be found rather than disappear.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="headingsub">Description</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>The project idea is to create a golf ball that can be tracked and more easily found. Two possible methods by which this could be achieved would be through sound or light, or through tracking.</p>
<p>Sound or light option</p>
<p>This option involves the golf ball being redesigned to include a speaker or light inside it to be able to use human senses to find it. The ball would play a sound or shine a light for the golfer to hear or see. However, this could impede the quiet nature of golf. Additionally, the effectiveness of this option would be limited as some golfers cannot hear or see well. It would also be difficult to manufacture a light or speaker into the ball with all the strict regulations that are in place for golf balls. Given these insights, this idea would not be optimal.</p>
<p>Tracking option</p>
<p>Another option is to include something inside the golf ball to make it possible for a machine to find it. This machine could be a handheld device or a device that is fixed to a golf bag\buggy. It could also be tracked by a smart phone using an app. The golf ball would have a GPS tracker inside it. The device or phone would track the ball and guide the golfer to its location. The location of the ball would be displayed on a course map and as the golfer then arrives in the general area of the ball, an arrow or dot would direct the golfer to the golf ball. Despite the similar difficulties in manufacturing, this option would be more optimal due to the end result being more functional and practical for the user.</p>
<p>The tracking option is the preferred method of developing this project idea. There are a number of considerations that would need to be addressed for this idea to work effectively. Firstly, the ball would need to conform to ruling regulations. Some of the regulations relate to weight, size, shape and stiffness. Secondly, a GPS tracking chip would need to be made and imbedded into the golf ball that can withstand extreme conditions. Some include withstand high impacts, temperature changes, water and sand. Lastly, an app or tracking device would need to be developed that is user friendly.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="headingsub">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>The two main software and hardware tools required for this project would be the development of a GPS tracking chip to be placed inside the golf ball, and a device or app that the user can use to track the ball’s location.</p>
<p>GPS inside the golf ball</p>
<p>The technologies needed to successfully develop the ball would be:</p>
<p>•	GPS - for tracking</p>
<p>•	NFC – for charging the ball</p>
<p>•	Golf ball technology for optimal spin and ball speed</p>
<p>Device/app</p>
<p>The software for this would need to be developed to connect to the ball and accurately relay the location of the ball to the user.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="headingsub">Skills Required</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>The skills required would be both in software and hardware fields. The development of the app UI would need skills of coding and programming. The GPS tracking within the app would need to be factored into the app development. The GPS tracking chip would need skills of circuit board design and creation, alongside putting a GPS node on the circuit board. The skill to incorporate NFC charging would also be needed. The skills of designing premium quality golf balls would be required to make the ball a viable replacement for current marketed golf balls whilst not losing performance gains.</p>
<p>The software for this project is very likely already developed but has not been integrated in this field. It would also be likely that the hardware required is available but again has not been integrated. This would increase the likeliness that this project idea would be very viable.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="headingsub">Outcome</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>If the project is successful, golfers who find it difficult to see their ball, or who often lose their ball will be able to find it easily! Receiving a 2-shot penalty for a lost ball will be no more. This development will have a positive impact on the golfing community as players will enjoy the opportunity to play more often without the hassle and cost of losing of a ball, or multiple. Big companies such as Callaway, TaylorMade and Titleist would most probably want to patent the idea and make a considerable profit from it. It may cause contention amongst professional fields as those who have the trackable ball would be at an advantage. Thus, it may prove difficult to have this ball regulated in competitions as it would need to be approved by PGA associations.</p>
